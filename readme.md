# Machine Learning Course Projects

## About
These are the project files I submitted for the machine learning course offered by Stanford University through Coursera. The course was instructed by Andrew Ng and offered great insight into the mathematical and applied principles of supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

All The files were written in Octave GNU. Many of the files were supplied by the course.
